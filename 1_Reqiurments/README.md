# Introduction:
In our daily life Water plays a vital role. The Availability of water in tank is one of the important parameter for every Household. If the Water level in tank is too low, Device must turn on the motor. Else if the level reaches high, Device must turn off the Motor. Since Water is the most essential thing, if the level's abnormal It disrupts the daily household chores. So we should maintain the Water level constantly.

# Features:
1.Detects the Water level in the tank and Manipulate the Motor state with respect to the level with alerting the User via Bluetooth module.

2.Available in low cost and in smaller sizes.

3.Simple circuit design and easy to understand.

# 4W'S and 1H:
## What?
* It is a Motor control based project which detects the Tank's water level and gives an alert over the Level and Motor State to the User.
## WHY?
* Its a good habit to keep our Daily water usage normal and also it is very needed for everyone to know the need of saving water so the devices like ours will be a first step in Saving water and electricity in every households. 
## WHERE?
* We can use it in every Households, Offices and also every Water needed Sectors.
## WHO?
*  It is an automated detector, So no need for any manual involvement to reset to normal value so every one who needs can use it.
## HOW?
* A sensor which is the main part of this project, It is the one which detects and transmits the value.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:
## Strength:
- Its strength is compact in size.
- Accuracy in displaying the correct Water Level.
- Automated Motor control.
- Cost efficient.
## Weakness:
- Due to the usage of electronic components in a Water Reserve, we need to be very careful in creating a Water-resistant environment.
## Opportunity:
- We should create an opportunity to make our product used by everyone by providing an awareness over the wastage of water and electricity due to less user attention and importance of surveiling the Motor for atmost care.
- Due to current Water demanding situation now it is needed everywhere in the world.
## Threat:
- Now there are many new developing devices for competition in the Water level Indication sector.
