# ABSTRACT

## WATER LEVEL INDICATION 
  A water level indicator is a system that relays information back to a control panel to indicate whether a body of water has a high or low water level. Some water level indicators use a combination of probe sensors or float switches to sense water levels. “The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container.” according to Electronics Hub.

## PURPOSE OF WATER LEVEL INDICATION 
  The purpose of a water level indicator is to gauge and manage water levels in a water tank. The control panel can also be programmed to automatically turn on a water pump once levels get too low and refill the water back to the adequate level.

## WATER LEVEL INDICATION SENSOR ?
  A water level indicator sensor, also known as a probe sensor, is what tells the control panel that corrective action is needed. A combination of high and low sensors are used to tell the control panel when water levels are too high or too low. The control panel will then automatically turn the pump on or off depending on the corrective action needed. Here in our porject, we are actually using Ultrasonic sensor to determine the Water level and to  otify the Controller inspite Probe sensor.
  
## WORKING PRINCIPLE 
  The working principle of a water level indicator is actually quite simple. Water level indicators work by using Ultrasonic Sensor to indicate water levels in a storage tank. These Sensors send information back to the control panel to trigger an alarm or indicator(LED). As mentioned above, the control panel can be programmed to automatically turn on your pump to refill the water again thereby Alerting the user via Bluetooth Sensor.
* The water level is full – Indicate High level, Send Alert message.
* Water level drops to the low level – Indicator LED is triggered.
* Motor is triggered automatically turning on the water to fill the tank
* Once the water is full, fill stop is triggered and the system automatically stops the Motor.
* The system resets and waits for water levels to drop again.

## APPLICATIONS 
Applications of a Water Level Indicator: 
Water level indicators can be used in Hotels, Pools, Factories, fire protection systems in buildings and more. Other applications and uses of a water level indicator include:
* Hotels
* Home apartments
* Commercial complexes
* Factories
* Where cooling towers are used
* Residential and commercial swimming pools
* Anywhere water levels need to be controlled
* Bore wells
* Sump Pumps
* Used to start and stop water pumps
* Water level indicator for water tank
